- About

This is simple implementation of the popular game Connect Four, in which two players take turns trying to stack four adjacent discs of their given color. It is playable locally by two players on a single screen, and built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Background

I decided to code this small project as my first attempt at grasping the basics of website development & design. Primarily an exercise in familiarization with jQuery, DOM manipulation, CSS animation.
